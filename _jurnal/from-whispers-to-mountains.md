I started this journey with a question that lingered in the silence: **"Whispers of What If."** It was a time when my mind was a storm of uncertainties—what if I’m not good enough? What if the path I choose leads nowhere? What if I fail those who depend on me? That first entry was the seed of everything I’ve written since.

Looking back, the early part of the year was a search for meaning through others, believing that "life is more beautiful when you make people happy." But the whispers of "what if" never truly left; they just changed their tune. By mid-year, they turned into the echoes of *Hey Jude*, a reminder of the fractured family and the heavy mantle of responsibility I carry while living with my grandmother. I had to learn to "take a sad song and make it better" while working to fund an education that often felt like a burden too heavy for a "kid" to bear.

Then came the internship months—a glimpse of hope fueled by the belief that "to win once, I need to lose many times." I faced the rejections, I felt the sting of loving someone I could never have, and I tried to silence the "what ifs" with action. But now, two months after the internship ended, the whispers are back, louder than ever.

I am exhausted. I am angry. I feel as if I am standing at the edge of a cliff, paralyzed by the fear of the fall. I see others moving, while I struggle to find work, feeling like a coward for not taking the risks I know I should. I realize now that "we accept the love (and the life) we think we deserve," and perhaps I’ve been accepting too little because I was still afraid of those old whispers.

But as 2025 comes to a close, I have to change the question. Instead of "what if I fail," I must ask, **"There is a mountain to be climbed, aren't they?"** The whispers haven't disappeared, but they’ve led me to the foot of this mountain. I’ve built my strength during the climb of this messy year, and now, it’s time to stop whispering and start climbing. Because **"the view is better from the top, but the strength is built during the climb."**
