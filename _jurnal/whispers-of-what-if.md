My thoughts often drift to alternative realities. What if the universe had treated us more favorably? What if the moment we met was different? What if we were different people? Our connection felt like a near miss – so close to becoming a lasting commitment, so close to being sufficient, so close to the enduring love we needed to weather our shared storms. Nevertheless, I understand that our time together was finite. The ache comes from knowing that a slight shift in circumstances, a single alignment of fate, a touch more bravery or luck, or just a little 'more' of something – could have given us everything we longed for. But, it wasn't to be. Now, these possibilities remain locked within me as perpetual '**what-ifs**.' Our ending is a story that wishing alone cannot rewrite.

There's a unique kind of sadness that comes with caring deeply for someone you feel you might not be able to hold onto. And, looking back, it feels like that's what I experienced with you. Maybe a part of me always knew our paths might diverge, especially with our different roles and aspirations. I often think about why our connection happened when it did. You came into my work life and made an impact. I responded with an openness to something special. And now, with you moving on, I'm left wondering about the '**what-ifs**' and the chances I might have missed.

What draws me to her is her character. I'm drawn to her because of who she is as a person. I admire so much about her: her personality, the way she interacts with others, her kindness, and her thoughtful mind.

Spending time with her is something I always look forward to. I enjoy her company; I absolutely love sitting next to her. The joy when we talk about everything – we have some similarities.

I always think about her even when she's not around. She often crosses my mind even when we're not together. After we spend time together, I find myself still thinking about her. (fyi, it was never just the two of us)

Part of me wishes we could be more than just friends. However, I feel like it's difficult right now because I'm not where I want to be financially. I worry that she might not see me as someone she'd want to be with if I'm not successful in my life. I have turned those words over in my mind so many times. I am trying to make them hurt less. However, it is what it is. They do not hurt less – they just make sense.

Since we aren't together anymore (read: don't meet constantly), I've had this fear in the back of my mind that she might meet someone else there. It's a worry that pops up sometimes. But at the same time, I am genuinely happy for her that she's moved to a better place for her.

Sometimes I feel a sense of regret for getting so close, knowing that it might not go anywhere right now. But honestly, the thought of not having had these interactions with her at all is even worse because... 

because I love her.



I still think about the ‘**what-ifs**’ sometimes.

*\>What if we had met at a different stage in our lives when things felt more equal?* 

*What if I had tried harder to bridge the gap between our worlds?* 

*What if I had found the courage to tell her how I truly felt, even with our differences?*

### **At the end of the day, the what-ifs do not matter. Because, we did meet. I did love you. and You didn't know.**

# ﻿**...**

Maybe love is not always about staying – sometimes, it reminds us of what it feels like to be truly seen, to be cherished, even if only for a little while. Love reminds us that we are capable of being loved, even if not forever.

There is a certain peace in acknowledging that not every story unfolds as we might hope. And perhaps, the connection we shared, in the way it was, is its own complete narrative. So, thank you. For entering my life when you did. Thank you for the moments we shared. You made those days more meaningful, and I'm thankful for the chance I had to connect with you. And who knows, maybe one day I'll gather the courage to express these feelings directly, ready for whatever the response might be. 

Because,  you were worth it. 

**You still are**.
