Well, today hit a bit different. Got the news about the internship—didn't get it. "**Didn't make the cut,**" they said. It stings, man, no lie. You pour a lot of energy into these things, right? The applications, the interviews, trying to picture yourself there, learning, contributing. You get your hopes up, even if you try to play it cool.

And then the email comes. Just a polite "thanks, but no thanks." It's a quick, sharp punch to the gut. All that effort, all that anticipation, just... evaporated. My mind immediately jumped to: "What did I do wrong? Was I not smart enough? Not experienced enough? Did I say something dumb in the interview?" It's easy to spiral into that self-doubt, picking apart every single thing.

I know, I know, people say "it's just one opportunity," and "there'll be others." And logically, I get that. But in the moment, it feels like a personal rejection. It feels like someone looked at what you offered, what you believed you could bring, and decided it wasn't quite enough. Maybe this is a tough lesson, but as they say, **"Every failure is a lesson if you learn from it."**

So, sitting here now, writing this down, I'm trying to shift my perspective a bit. This "no" isn't a reflection of my *entire* worth, or my *entire* potential. It just means this specific door, at this specific time, didn't open. There could be a hundred reasons why—they might have had an internal candidate, someone with a very niche skill, or maybe it just wasn't the right fit on either side, and that's okay too.

For now, I'll let myself feel the sting, acknowledge the disappointment. But you know what? Right after I got the news, my mind kinda just... drifted. And then it hit me: even if this particular door closed, there's still **nasi pecel** out there. Seriously. That warm rice, the fresh greens, the spicy peanut sauce, the crispy rempeyek... that's a comfort that's always available.

So, yeah, I might not have an internship for *this* time, but I definitely have a plan for dinner. This isn't the end of the road. It's just a detour. And sometimes, a little bit of that familiar, delicious comfort is exactly what you need to brush it off, learn whatever lessons I can from the experience, and get back in the game. The search continues, fuelled by good food.
