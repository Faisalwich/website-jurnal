That thought hit me today: **"To win once, I need to lose many times."** It's so simple, but it feels like such a heavy, honest truth.

We're all so focused on the one big win—the success story, the final victory, the perfect result. But what we don't always talk about is all the stuff that comes before it. The failed attempts, the wrong turns, the moments you wanted to give up and thought you weren’t good enough.

Losing isn't just an outcome; it's a process. Every time you fall short, you're learning something. For me, that meant sending out countless job applications and only getting one call for an internship. It meant not getting that job I really wanted, even after pouring everything into the interviews. It meant falling in love with someone I couldn't have, and having to deal with that kind of quiet pain.

Each one of those moments felt like a complete loss. They were frustrating, draining, and full of doubt. But looking back now, I can see how they were all building blocks. They taught me what to work on, how to handle disappointment, and that my worth isn’t tied to a single outcome or a single person. They're the foundation that makes the final victory possible.

The wins that feel the most earned aren't the easy ones. They're the ones that are built on a mountain of losses. The losses give the win its meaning. They make you appreciate the moment you finally get it right, because you know exactly how many times you got it wrong.

So maybe the point isn’t to avoid losing. Maybe the point is to lose well. To learn from every single time, to get back up, and to remember that every time you fall, you’re just one step closer to a victory that feels more meaningful than you could have ever imagined.
